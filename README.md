# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Objective

Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.

Independent Funding has been growing, so now it needs to move all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This way, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects. The following need to be met:

* Extract and transform the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files

* Create a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD

* Load the CSV files into the database

* Perform SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders

## Resources
